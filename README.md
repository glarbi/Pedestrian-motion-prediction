# Pedestrian-motion-prediction
In the field of road safety, pedestrian detection remains a field of research despite the changes it has undergone since its creation. A camera makes it possible to recover images which will be processed to detect the passage of pedestrians. The problems to be solved in this project are: • Detection and localization of a moving object • Be able to decide if the detected object is a pedestrian • Predict the movement of the pedestrian according to his position
